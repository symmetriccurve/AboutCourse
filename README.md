About Trainer 

I have Designed/Developed/Deployed Production ready applications over 5 years both on web and mobile platforms.

Apart from building things, I love to teach. Combining my profession with my passion to teach made me a UI trainer. I have mentored, supported and trained more than 200 students/developers over a span of 2 years. I am working with Reactjs for over 3 years now, and I enjoy training this technology from the ground up.

I can train the students who are familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript as React Developers in 2 weeks time, by the end of the course students should able to debug and breakdown a complex real-time application, since React is all about building blocks based on State and Props, we master them during the session.

I do not believe in concrete curriculum, I discuss with the students ahead of training and design my curriculum according to their expectations from the course. What I believe is, a standard course structure might repeat the things that the students already know about, this would kill a lot of interactive time. I make use of huge number of illustrations/diagram during training sessions to break complex workflows and provide visual shortcuts to the subject

The training includes interview questions, everyday quizzes , assignments and workshops, mock interviews, and keen focus on every student. Every session is recorded and provided lifetime access with provided email address.
